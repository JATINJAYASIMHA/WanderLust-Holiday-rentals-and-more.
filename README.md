# WanderLust-Holiday-rentals-and-more.
Project Summary: 

"Wanderlust," a feature-rich web application created to make it easier to browse and book holiday rentals, such as homes, villas, and farmhouses, is a Full Stack Web Development project. Users of this platform can add their own houses to the listing, giving prospective tenants a wide variety of possibilities. Integrated chatbot support for immediate user assistance, a smooth booking system that streamlines the reservation process, and real-time property location views via Google Live Map are some of the key features. For improved security and user experience, the application offers quick login options via GitHub OAuth and Google OAuth. In addition, the application has an attractive, user-friendly interface that guarantees a productive and entertaining user experience, as well as a dynamic server for responsive performance.

Front-end:

* Developed a responsive web application using modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Implemented a user-friendly interface for searching and listing properties.
* Integrated Google Maps API for location-based search and property mapping.
* Integrated AI Chat Assistant where you ask any questions.

Back-end:

* Built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js to handle user interactions.
* Implemented user authentication and authorization using technologies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
* For easy and fast registration Google & Github authentication has been implemented.
* Created endpoints for property listing, login/sign up and user management.
* AI Chat Assistant where you ask any question to it.

Database:

* Utilized a relational database management system MongoDB for storing property and user data.
* Designed a well-structured database schema for efficient data management.
* Employed database queries to retrieve and store property and user information.
* 
Additional Features:

* Implemented a search and filter system for property listings.

* Ensured security and data privacy through encryption and data validation.
* Deployed the web application on a cloud platform on Cloudinary to make it accessible online.
* Google and Github Authentication for fast login or sign-up for a user.

My ability to handle all aspects of full-stack web development, from designing an eye-catching front end to maintaining the back end and database, is demonstrated by this project. It enables users to effortlessly and securely look for properties and utilize the main features of airbnb, a similar website.
